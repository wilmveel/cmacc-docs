If there is a {{def.Dissolution_Event}} before this {{def.instrument}} expires or terminates, the Company will pay an amount equal to the Purchase Amount, due and payable to the Investor immediately prior to, or concurrent with, the consummation of the {{def.Dissolution_Event}}. The Purchase Amount will be paid prior and in preference to any Distribution of any of the assets of the Company to holders of outstanding Capital Stock by reason of their ownership thereof. If immediately prior to the consummation of the {{def.Dissolution_Event}}, the assets of the Company legally available for distribution to the Investor and all holders of all other Safes (the "Dissolving Investors"), as determined in good faith by the Company's board of directors, are insufficient to permit the payment to the Dissolving Investors of their respective Purchase Amounts, then the entire assets of the Company legally available for distribution will be distributed with equal priority and pro rata among the Dissolving Investors in proportion to the Purchase Amounts they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 1.3.
