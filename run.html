<li><p><strong>Events</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span class=\"definedterm\">Equity Financing</span></strong>  <ol>
<li>If there is an <span class=\"definedterm\">Equity Financing</span> before the expiration or termination of this instrument, the Willem will automatically issue to the Investor a number of shares of Safe Preferred Stock equal to the <span class=\"definedterm\">Purchase Amount</span> divided by the <span class=\"definedterm\">Conversion Price</span>.</li>
<li>In connection with the issuance of Safe Preferred Stock by the Willem to the Investor pursuant to this Section 1:<ol>
<li>The Investor will execute and deliver to the Willem all transaction documents related to the <span class=\"definedterm\">Equity Financing</span>; provided, that such documents are the same documents to be entered into with the purchasers of Standard Preferred Stock, with appropriate variations for the Safe Preferred Stock if applicable, and provided further, that such documents have customary exceptions to any drag-along applicable to the Investor, including, without limitation, limited representations and warranties and limited liability and indemnification obligations on the part of the Investor; and  </li>
<li>The Investor and the Willem will execute a Pro Rata Rights Agreement, unless the Investor is already included in such rights in the transaction documents related to the <span class=\"definedterm\">Equity Financing</span>.  </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong><span class=\"definedterm\">Liquidity Event</span></strong>  <ol>
<li>If there is a <span class=\"definedterm\">Liquidity Event</span> before the expiration or termination of this instrument, the Investor will, at its option, either (i) receive a cash payment equal to the Purchase Amount (subject to the following paragraph) or (ii) automatically receive from the Company a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the Liquidity Price, if the Investor fails to select the cash option.</li>
<li>In connection with Section 1.2.1, the Purchase Amount will be due and payable by the Company to the Investor immediately prior to, or concurrent with, the consummation of the <span class=\"definedterm\">Liquidity Event</span>. If there are not enough funds to pay the Investor and holders of other Safes (collectively, the &quot;Cash-Out Investors&quot;) in full, then all of the Company&#39;s available funds will be distributed with equal priority and pro rata among the Cash-Out Investors in proportion to their Purchase Amounts, and the Cash-Out Investors will automatically receive the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the remaining unpaid Purchase Amount divided by the Liquidity Price. In connection with a Change of Control intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization, the Company may reduce, pro rata, the Purchase Amounts payable to the Cash-Out Investors by the amount determined by its board of directors in good faith to be advisable for such Change of Control to qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and in such case, the Cash-Out Investors will automatically receive the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the remaining unpaid Purchase Amount divided by the Liquidity Price.  </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong><span class=\"definedterm\">Equity Financing</span></strong><br> If there is a <span class=\"definedterm\">Dissolution Event</span> before this this <span class=\"definedterm\">instrument</span> expires or terminates, the Company will pay an amount equal to the Purchase Amount, due and payable to the Investor immediately prior to, or concurrent with, the consummation of the <span class=\"definedterm\">Dissolution Event</span>. The Purchase Amount will be paid prior and in preference to any Distribution of any of the assets of the Company to holders of outstanding Capital Stock by reason of their ownership thereof. If immediately prior to the consummation of the <span class=\"definedterm\">Dissolution Event</span>, the assets of the Company legally available for distribution to the Investor and all holders of all other Safes (the &quot;Dissolving Investors&quot;), as determined in good faith by the Company&#39;s board of directors, are insufficient to permit the payment to the Dissolving Investors of their respective Purchase Amounts, then the entire assets of the Company legally available for distribution will be distributed with equal priority and pro rata among the Dissolving Investors in proportion to the Purchase Amounts they would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 1.3. </li>
<li><strong><span class=\"definedterm\">Equity Financing</span></strong><br> This instrument will expire and terminate (without relieving the Company of any obligations arising from a prior breach of or non-compliance with this instrument) upon either (i) the issuance of stock to the Investor pursuant to Section 1.1 or Section 1.2.2; or (ii) the payment, or setting aside for payment, of amounts due the Investor pursuant to Section 1.2.1 or Section 1.3.</li>
